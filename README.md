# OctoPrint-Keepsilkopen

The Echo Show family work great for monitoring an OctoPrint job, EXCEPT that the Silk browser will timeout after a few minutes and you'll need to re-open the browser.

This plugin adds a background *silent* mp3 that plays in the background. This is enough to make Silk think that the page is active. It should only activate when the browser is Silk.

Full credit goes to DaGammla for developing this functionality. I simply pulled it into an OctoPrint plugin. Go buy them a coffee! [![ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/img/githubbutton_sm.svg)](https://ko-fi.com/Z8Z7AO1BI)

## Setup

Install via the bundled [Plugin Manager](https://docs.octoprint.org/en/master/bundledplugins/pluginmanager.html)
or manually using this URL:

    https://github.com/akuker/OctoPrint-KeepSilkOpen/archive/main.zip

If the plugin is active, you will see an additional icon in the nav bar that takes you to this page.

## Configuration

No configuration necessary for this plugin. You can turn it on/off in the Plugin Manager of OctoPrint.
